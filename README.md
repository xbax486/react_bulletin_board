This is a simple bulletin_board application built using React. It allows you to add, edit and delete notes on the board. I also upload an image to show how the app should look while running. 

Few things to know:

1. All the node will be randomly positioned on the board once added. 

2. Make sure you have Node installed.

3. Before running the app, please install the two modules-httpster and react-tools. 
    (command : npm install --save httpster,  npm install --save react-tools)

4. To run the app, type 'npm start'. The app will be run on localhost on port 4321.

Please feel free to add any comment related to the code.
