This is a simple bulletin_board application built using React. It allows you to add, edit and delete notes on the board.

Few things to know:

1. All the node will be randomly positioned on the board once added. 

2. Make sure you have Node installed.

3. Before running the app, please install the two modules-httpster and react-tools. 
    (command : npm install --save httpster,  npm install --save react-tools)

4. To run the app, type 'npm start'. The app will be run on localhost on port 4321.

5. While the app is running, 50 notes will be generated on the board. To add a new note, click on the green button on top right corner.

6. To edit or delete the note, hover over the specific note and click on the pencil button and start editing. Once done, click on the disk button to save changes. To delete the note, simply click on the trash button when you hover over the note.
